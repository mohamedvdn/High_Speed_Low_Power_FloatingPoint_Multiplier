# High_Speed_Low_Power_FloatingPoint_Multiplier

## Overview

This floating-point multiplier design emphasizes optimizing the mantissa part through the integration of both Karatsuba and Urdhva techniques, culminating in a Hybrid Vedic Multiplier. The Vedic Multiplier principles, rooted in ancient Indian mathematics, introduce innovative methods for multiplication. The hybrid approach signifies a synergistic blend of these diverse techniques, specifically applied within the mantissa segment of the floating-point multiplier.

The primary objective is to achieve a high level of precision in mantissa calculations, crucial for accurate representation of real numbers in scientific and engineering contexts. This design choice reflects a strategic amalgamation of traditional and ancient mathematical methodologies, with the potential to yield improved performance and optimization in the mantissa multiplication process.

## Key Components

1. **Karatsuba and Urdhva Techniques Integration**: Karatsuba algorithm and Urdhva Tiryagbhyam algorithm are integrated to optimize the mantissa multiplication process.

2. **Vedic Multiplier Principles**: Leveraging ancient Indian mathematical techniques to enhance multiplication efficiency.

3. **Hybrid Approach**: A synergistic blend of Karatsuba, Urdhva, and Vedic Multiplier techniques specifically tailored for mantissa multiplication.

## Design Objectives
